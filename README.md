Here you can find the model of the Marmac 304, the ship that is used for Space X landings,

ship which is also known as **Of course I still love you (OCISLY)**

You can see photos of the ship I used for making of this model [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jc2snurk24o9cq0/AADZW3qmElcvnz1lQIbQlDDra?dl=0)

Huge thanks to all fans that made these photos, without them it would be impossible to make the model.

Final model will be in 1:100 scale although currently for development I use various scales.

# Available submodels

## dimision_plan
this is as detailed as possible orthorgraphic rendering of the ship, showing basic dimisions.

It serves here the role of 'golden' model - from it I take all the dimensions for rest of the model.

**STATUS:** 

*Design*: As of today, it should be up to date with the OCISLY prior to CRS-8 launch
Now needs update to blast walls and adding the ladder (not importataint)

*Tutorial*: N/A

*Testing*: N/A


## hull_model

This is model for a foamboard base and  set of printable decals to be glued onto the hull base that is made of foamboard to give ship its texturing.

Foamboard base model went through major redesign and now has printable templates that can be transferred to foamboard easily (using needle for instance)

Current scale: (1 foot = 1 mm scale) - set of A4 pages

Some pages which are just mirror images are missing - will create them only in final PDF
