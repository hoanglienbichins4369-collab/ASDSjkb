Here you can find the model of the Marmac 304, the ship that is used for Space X landings.

Also known as Of course I still love you (OCISLY)

You can see photos of the ship I used for making of this model [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jc2snurk24o9cq0/AADZW3qmElcvnz1lQIbQlDDra?dl=0)
Huge thanks to all fans that made these photos, without them it would be impossible to make the model.

Final model will be in 1:100 scale although currently for development I use (1 foot = i mm scale) 

# Folder structure

## 1.overview
this is as detailed as possible orthorgraphic rendering of the ship - golden model.

It is not intended to be printed, but only used to get general idea of the model.

It also serves here the role of 'golden' model - from it I take all the dimensions for rest of the model.

**STATUS:** As of today, it should be up to date with the OCISLY.

## 2. cardboard

This is set of the instructions to cut and create an carboard model to serve as the base of the ship
It is needed since ship at 1:100 is huge so it won't support itself if only made of paper.

I will eventually add an tutorial explaining every step in the model making.

You can also skip printing these files since you will only read them, but a print is handy to
have while doing the cutting/gluing.

**STATUS:** Model is complete and even made in real life, but maybe needs an update to wings lengths
(and the real life model needs a surgery to fix this...)

## 3.parts

This is the draft of the paper model. It is in 1 foot == 1 mm scale, to avoid mistakes,
When I finish I will once convert these pages to A3 pages that will be printed.

**STATUS:** Very outdated - will work on this next


## 4.engine

Model of Thrustmaster OD1000 engine.

Here the model is in **model.svg**
Here currently scale is (1 inch = 1 mm) 

Rest are processed DWG drawings from the Trustmaster website,converted to SVG, cleaned up of junk, broken down to layers, and in some cases have some parts added by guessing.

(Especially straight-side.svg - this is sort of golden model for the engine)

I will also soon add an tutorial on how to create the model, as it is quite hard.

**STATUS:** One prototype was made, then model received lot of small updates.

Soon will make another prototype to test again the quality.
Model should be complete.
