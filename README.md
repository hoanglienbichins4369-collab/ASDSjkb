Here you can find the model of the marmac 304, the ship that is used for Space X landings.
You can see photos of the ship I used for making of this model [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jc2snurk24o9cq0/AADZW3qmElcvnz1lQIbQlDDra?dl=0)
Huge thanks to all fans that made these photos, without them it would be impossible to make the model.
