Here you can find the model of the Marmac 304, the ship that is used for Space X landings.

Also known as Of course I still love you (OCISLY)

You can see photos of the ship I used for making of this model [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jc2snurk24o9cq0/AADZW3qmElcvnz1lQIbQlDDra?dl=0)

Huge thanks to all fans that made these photos, without them it would be impossible to make the model.

Final model will be in 1:100 scale although currently for development I use (1 foot = i mm scale)

## golden_model
this is as detailed as possible orthorgraphic rendering of the ship - golden model.

It serves here the role of 'golden' model - from it I take all the dimensions for rest of the model.

It is not intended to be printed, but only used to get general idea of the model.

**STATUS:** 

Design: As of today, it should be up to date with the OCISLY prior to CRS-8 launch
Now needs update to blast walls and adding the ladder (not importataint)

Tutorial: N/A

Testing: N/A

## 2. foamboard
This is set of the instructions to cut and create an foamboard model to serve as the base of the ship.

It is needed since ship at 1:100 is huge so it won't support itself if only made of paper.

I will eventually add an tutorial explaining every step in the model making.

You can also skip printing these files since you will only read them, but a print is handy to
have while doing the cutting/gluing.

To build you need two 1meter x 70 cm sheets of 4 mm thick foamboard. 5 or 3 mm probalby will
work just fine, but thiker that 5 mm foamboard is not recommented.

You will also need a brick of Plasticine (or some other semi soft modelling clay) to fill
some voids.

**STATUS:** 

Design: **DONE**

Testing: [DONE](https://twitter.com/maximlevitsky/status/706599126876684288).

Tutorial: **TODO**


## base_model
This is set of large decals to be glued onto the foamboard to give all the awesome
SpaceX branding, etc.

It is intended to be set of A3 pages to be printed in color, but I might swithc
to A4 later.

**STATUS:** 

Design: *Mostly done, needs verifying*

Testing: **TODO**

Tutorial: **TODO**
