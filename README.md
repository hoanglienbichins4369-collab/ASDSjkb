Here you can find the model of the Marmac 304, the ship that is used for Space X landings.

Also known as Of course I still love you (OCISLY)

You can see photos of the ship I used for making of this model [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jc2snurk24o9cq0/AADZW3qmElcvnz1lQIbQlDDra?dl=0)

Huge thanks to all fans that made these photos, without them it would be impossible to make the model.

Final model will be in 1:100 scale although currently for development I use (1 foot = i mm scale)

# Folder structure

## golden_model
this is as detailed as possible orthorgraphic rendering of the ship - golden model.

It serves here the role of 'golden' model - from it I take all the dimensions for rest of the model.

It is not intended to be printed, but only used to get general idea of the model.

**STATUS:** As of today, it should be up to date with the OCISLY.

## 2. foamboard
This is set of the instructions to cut and create an foamboard model to serve as the base of the ship.

It is needed since ship at 1:100 is huge so it won't support itself if only made of paper.

I will eventually add an tutorial explaining every step in the model making.

You can also skip printing these files since you will only read them, but a print is handy to
have while doing the cutting/gluing.

To build you need two 1meter x 70 cm sheets of 4 mm thick foamboard. 5 or 3 mm probalby will
work just fine, but thiker that 5 mm foamboard is not recommented.

You will also need a brick of Plasticine (or some other semi soft modelling clay) to fill
some voids.

**STATUS:** As of today, it should be up to date with the OCISLY and it was tested except
minor modifications that unlikely to break it.

## base_model
This is set of large decals to be glued onto the foamboard to give all the awesome
SpaceX branding, etc.

It is intended to be set of A3 pages to be printed in color, but I might swithc
to A4 later.

**STATUS:** Ship body done, but untested. Needs testing especially on sides and bottom model

## eqipment

Here I will add models of the equipments used on the ship.


**STATUS:** Model of the thrustmaster OD1000 done

Also needs tutorial


# TODO - modelling
This is the stuff that is physically missing from the model
* Fence
* Thrustmaster power units
* White containers
* Generators
* Blast walls (don't forget the four leaf clover...)
* Two towers

# TODO - building model
This is the stuff I should do to verify that my models work in real life 

(since only in theory there is no difference between threory and real world)

* Build platform models
* fix up the foamboard model I have with correct wings lengths (real foamboard model I have)
* print the decals for the foamboard model and glue them to it.
* build 3 engines + **record tutorial on engine building**
* build rest of deck equipment.
* Optional - build another foamboard model and **record tutorial on foamboard building**
* Optional - **create tutorial on gluing decals to the foamboard**
* Ship it :-)
* Make insturctions for Just read the Instructions.
