Here you can find the model of the Marmac 304, the ship that is used for Space X landings,

ship which is also known as **Of course I still love you (OCISLY)**

You can see photos of the ship I used for making of this model [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jc2snurk24o9cq0/AADZW3qmElcvnz1lQIbQlDDra?dl=0)

Huge thanks to all fans that made these photos, without them it would be impossible to make the model.

Final model will be in 1:100 scale although currently for development I use various scales.

# Available submodels

## dimision_plan
this is as detailed as possible orthorgraphic rendering of the ship, showing basic dimisions.

It serves here the role of 'golden' model - from it I take all the dimensions for rest of the model.

**STATUS:** 

*Design*: As of today, it should be up to date with the OCISLY prior to CRS-8 launch
Now needs update to blast walls and adding the ladder (not importataint)

*Tutorial*: N/A

*Testing*: N/A

## hull_base

This is set of the instructions to cut and create an foamboard model to serve as the hull of the ship.

It is needed since ship at 1:100 is huge so it won't support itself if only made of paper.

To build you need two 1meter x 70 cm sheets of 4 mm thick foamboard. 5 or 3 mm probalby will
work just fine, but thiker that 5 mm foamboard is not recommented.

You will also need a brick of Plasticine (or some other semi soft modelling clay) to fill
some voids.

You might want to print this model to have off-line set of instructions on cutting.

**STATUS:** 

*Design*: **DONE**

*Testing*: [DONE](https://twitter.com/maximlevitsky/status/706599126876684288).

*Tutorial*: **TODO**

## hull_model

This is set of printable decals to be glued onto the hull base that is made of foamboard to give ship its texturing.

Current scale: (1 foot = 1 mm scale) with intention to make either A4 or A3 set of pages to be printed

**STATUS:** 

Design: *Mostly done, needs verifying*

Testing: **TODO**

Tutorial: **TODO**
